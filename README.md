# Plaza

![Plaza demo](demo.gif)

Plaza is a customizable and riceable terminal UI for finding, installing, and managing packages. You search
once and it queries every package source on the system at the same time. On Arch
that means the official repositories and the AUR; on Debian it means apt; on
Fedora it means dnf. Results are merged into one list, so a package name shows up
once even when several sources provide it. A separate Manage view lists everything
installed, shows what has updates, and lets you remove or upgrade without leaving
Plaza. Actions run in a background pane backed by a real terminal, so you can keep
working while one runs.

Plaza supports Arch (pacman and the AUR), Debian (apt), and Fedora (dnf), and also
searches Flatpak (Flathub) when it is set up. The source backends sit behind a
trait, so zypper, snap, and others can be added later. Search, detail, install,
and the Manage view (installed list, removal, and upgrade) all work for every
enabled source: pacman, the AUR, apt, dnf, and Flatpak. Plaza shows only what fits
the system it runs on, so Arch-specific controls do not appear on Debian or Fedora
and the reverse.

## What it does

Search:

- Queries all sources at once: the official repos and the AUR on Arch, apt on
  Debian, dnf on Fedora, and Flatpak (Flathub) when it is configured. Packages
  with the same name across sources are merged into one row.
- Groups name variants (`gimp`, `gimp-bin`, `gimp-git`) and a name-matching
  Flatpak into a single row, so you pick the edition from the detail view.
  Matching uses the Flatpak app ID, then a normalized name, so a Flatpak whose
  app name matches a repo package joins its row (multi-word app names stay on
  their own to avoid wrong merges). Two independent options control this: "Stack
  package variants" (the `-bin`/`-git` family) and "Group matching Flatpak"; turn
  either off for one row per exact name.
- A grouped row shows one badge per source. When several variants share a source,
  the "Variant badge" option renders them as a count (`aur ×3`, the default) or
  repeated (`aur aur aur`). Badges carry the skin's per-source icon
  (repo/aur/flatpak) when icons are enabled.
- Shows every repo or source that provides a package, with versions and what is
  already installed. The repo pacman installs from by default is marked.
- Can install from a specific repo instead of the default.
- Streams results in as each source replies, so a slow or offline source does not
  block the rest.
- Flags AUR packages whose PKGBUILD changed in the last seven days.

Manage:

- Lists every installed package with its origin repo (or `aur`), filterable by
  typing.
- Sorts the list by name, size, or updated (last install/upgrade) from the filter
  box (`f`) `sort` section. The active key shows a direction arrow; pick it again
  to flip ascending/descending. The "Float upgradable to top" option (on by
  default, in the options menu) keeps upgradable packages above the sorted order.
  Upgradable packages are marked with the new version. Size and dates cover pacman
  and Flatpak packages.
- Removes the selected package at a configurable depth (`-Rs` by default, also
  `-Rns` or `-R`, set in options).
- Upgrades per source or all at once from the sidebar `UPDATES/INSTALLED` block:
  press Enter on a source row to upgrade that source, or Enter on the `total`
  row to upgrade all. "All" chains each source in one task (`sudo pacman -Syu &&
  paru -Sua`, using whichever AUR helper you have). Press Enter on an upgradable
  package in the Manage list to open a small menu (upgrade just that package,
  remove it, or cancel); for an up-to-date package Enter goes straight to remove.
  Press `u` from anywhere to jump focus to the sidebar upgrade block (cursor on
  `total`, so a following Enter upgrades all).
- Shows a detail pane beside the list (`pacman -Qi` for the highlighted package):
  version, install date, build date, size, install reason (explicit or
  dependency), what requires it, and what it depends on. Loaded as the selection
  moves. The pane hides on narrow terminals.
- Filters the list by installation reason from the filter box (`f`): all,
  explicitly installed only, or orphans (dependencies nothing requires,
  `pacman -Qdt`). The box's `sort` section sets the key and direction. Save the
  current reason, sort, and filter choices as the launch default with `s`.

General:

- Filters either list by repository. Press `f` for a checkbox box in the sidebar
  to show only the repos you pick (toggle one repo, all pacman repos at once, or
  the AUR). In the Manage view the box also has a reason section (all, explicit,
  orphans) and a sort section (name, size, updated). It
  follows the collapse-repos option. By default the box appears only
  while you are in it or while a filter is active; turn off "hide filter box when
  not in use" in options to keep it on screen at all times. Search and Manage
  keep separate filters, so hiding a repo in one view does not affect the other.
  Press `s` in the box to save the current view's filter as its launch default;
  otherwise the selection resets each launch.
- Actions run in a background pane backed by a real terminal, so sudo prompts and
  AUR build questions work normally. A hotkey returns you to it.
- Confirming an action adds it to a queue. The queue runs one task at a time,
  moves on by itself when a task succeeds, and pauses on a failure for you to
  dismiss or clear. Auto-advance does not pull you back to the pane, and queued
  items can be removed one at a time from it.
- When a running task stops at a prompt (sudo password, a pacman or AUR
  question) and you are not on the action pane, the status bar tells you it is
  waiting for input and which key opens the pane to answer.
- A small options menu (press `o`), grouped into categories (Appearance, Search,
  Manage, Filters, General): hide the keybinding hints, collapse all repos into
  one `[official]` badge, switch the color palette and skin (see
  [Theming](#theming)), set the search delay, pick the remove depth, choose the
  AUR helper (auto, yay, or paru), stack package variants and group a matching
  Flatpak (two toggles), pick the variant-badge style (count or repeat), float
  upgradable packages to the top of the Manage list, choose whether the filter
  box hides when it is not in use,
  pick how the matched substring is drawn in result and Manage names (off, color,
  underline, or both), and turn desktop notifications on or off. Settings are
  saved to `~/.config/plaza/settings.json`.
- Desktop notifications (via `notify-send`, on by default, toggleable in
  options): when a background task finishes or stops to wait for input while
  you are not watching its pane, plaza notifies you so a forgotten install
  never sits silently at a sudo prompt.
- Update check (on by default, toggleable in options): at startup plaza asks
  the GitHub releases API once whether a newer plaza version exists and, if
  so, shows a note in the sidebar. Turning "Check for plaza updates" off in
  options stops the network call entirely.

## Requirements

On Debian and Ubuntu, apt and dpkg are all Plaza needs; they are part of the
base system. On Fedora, dnf and rpm are likewise all it needs. The rest of this
list applies to Arch:

- pacman, for official-repo search, install, and removal
- an AUR helper (yay or paru), for AUR installs and upgrades. AUR search itself
  needs no helper; with neither installed you can still browse AUR results.
- checkupdates (from pacman-contrib), for live update counts without root
- flatpak with a remote configured (optional), to search and install from
  Flatpak. Installs use `--user`. With no remote, the Flatpak source stays off.
- Rust and Cargo, to build

## Install

On Debian or Ubuntu, download the `.deb` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/StaszeKrk/plaza/releases/latest) and:

```sh
sudo apt install ./plaza_*.deb
```

On Arch, as a pacman package (tracked by pacman, removable with
`pacman -R plaza`):

```sh
makepkg -si
```

Or build directly with Cargo:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/plaza
```

A headless search is also available:

```sh
plaza --search firefox
```

## Navigation

Plaza has two modes, like a tiling layout you tab around:

- Navigate: arrow keys (or `hjkl`) move the highlighted panel. The highlight is
  shown with the theme's hover border color (amber in the default theme).
- Interact: press Enter or Space to focus the highlighted panel. Its border turns
  the theme's active accent color and the arrow keys now act inside it (move the
  selection, type in the search box). Press Esc to step back to navigate.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| type | search (or filter, in Manage); the bar is focused at launch |
| Enter (in search) | run it and focus the results |
| arrows, hjkl | navigate mode: move the highlight. interact mode: move inside the panel |
| Enter, Space | focus the highlighted panel |
| Esc | step out of the focused panel |
| Tab | switch between the Search and Manage views |
| / | jump to the search bar from anywhere |
| f | open or close the repository filter; Space toggles a checkbox |
| s (in the filter box) | save the current view's filter (repos, plus reason and sort in Manage) as its launch default |
| Enter (on a result) | open it, then Enter on a source to install |
| r (in Manage list) | remove the selected package |
| Enter (in Manage list) | open the action menu (upgrade/remove/cancel) if the package has a pending update, else remove it |
| u | jump to the sidebar upgrade block from anywhere (cursor on `total`, so Enter upgrades all) |
| Enter (on a sidebar upgrade row) | upgrade that source; Enter on the `total` row upgrades all |
| backtick | open or collapse the action pane |
| j/k, d, x (in the action pane) | move within the queue, remove the selected item, or clear it |
| Ctrl-C in a focused action | cancel that action |
| o | options |
| q | quit; during an action it switches to the action instead |

Search and Manage keep separate search text, so switching views does not lose
either one.

## Theming

Plaza's look is split into two independent, swappable parts:

- a **palette**: the colors
- a **skin**: everything else (border style, corner radius, glyphs/icons, and the
  highlight and badge styles).

Switch either one live from the options menu (`o`): the `Palette` and `Skin` rows
cycle through the built-ins plus anything you have added, and the choice is saved
to `~/.config/plaza/settings.json`.

Built-in palettes: `plaza-dusk` (default), `gruvbox`, `nord`, `dracula`,
`tokyo-night`, `solarized-dark`, `catppuccin-mocha`, and `ansi` (which uses your terminal's own 16
colors, so it follows whatever theme the terminal is set to). Built-in skins:
`soft` (default), `sharp`, and `plain` (square borders and no Nerd Font glyphs,
for terminals without one).

To make your own, drop a `.toml` file in `~/.config/plaza/palettes/` or
`~/.config/plaza/skins/`. The file name is the theme name. Plaza loads new files
on the next launch, and edits to the file that is currently active reload live.
A palette file may set only the colors it wants to change; the rest fall back to
the default. See [docs/theming.md](docs/theming.md) for the full format and field
list.
